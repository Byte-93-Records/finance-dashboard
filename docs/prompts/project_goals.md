# Project Goals

What I'd like is to create a new project using [maybe](https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe) as inspiration but it will be very simple and a complete rehaul.

I'll use postgresql, grafana, maybe go or python for processing etc. we can dicsuss that later but my features are essentially converting bank statements in pdf to csv using docling and then read the csv and process that data and store in postgresql and visualize that in grafana and mayeb have all this as a docker file.

Based on the ask can you create a formal project goals summary to feed to an agent that can update the openspec #project.md file?
